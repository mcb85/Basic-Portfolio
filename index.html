    <p>
            I am Mariana Bromfield, a school psychologist, looking to become a web developer.
            I am currently "employed" as a stay-at-home mommy (best job ever), but I've worked
            in the public school system for 8 years as a school psychologist. I completed my Bachelors of Science in 
            Psychology at the University of Central Florida. I received a Masters of Science, as well as an Education
            Specialist degree (both in School Psychology) from Florida State University. 
            
            I was born in the Dominican Republic, but grew up in New York City and Central Florida.
            I currently live in Winter Garden, FL. My hobbies include going to the movies,
            reading novels, and traveling. I love spending time with my family. 
            
            I am super excited for this new career path!
